# FINALPROJECT

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:
Find a Problem worth Solving, Analyzing, or Visualizing

Use ML in the context of technologies learned

You must use:

Sci-Kit Learn and/or another machine learning library
You must use at least two of the below
* Python Pandas
* Python Matplotlib

You must use at least two of the below:

Python Tweepy, Python Flask, HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, JavaScript Plotly, Javascript D3.js, JavaScript Leaflet, MySQL Database, MongoDB Database, Google Cloud SQL, Amazon AWS, Tableau.

-Prepare a 15 minute “data deep dive” or “infrastructure walkthrough” that shows machine learning the context of what we’ve already learned.

Example Projects:

Create a Front-End Interface that Maps to an API to “Smarten” the Algorithm
Perform a Deep Dive of Existing Data Using Machine Learning
Create a Visualization that Continues to “Learn” Where Clusters Lie Based on ML (Use D3 or Plotly to Change the Visualization)
Create an idea with “mock data” that simulates how machine learning might be used
Create an analysis of existing data to make a prediction, classification, or regression
